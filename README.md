I want to die.

Hi everyone!  I am a freshman at Wright State University studying Computer Science.  I like ice cream, tacos, and Italian food.  My hobbies include improv comedy, playing Ingress, and listening to music.  I host a radio show here on campus called "Rockin' Raider" every Thusday from 5-7 PM.
